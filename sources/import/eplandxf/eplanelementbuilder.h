	The geometry is kept (8 mm EPLAN grid -> 20 px), terminals sit on the
	10 px wiring grid and face the nearest side of the device frame. Every
	empty EPLAN field (PLC address, symbolic address, function text) becomes
	a user text of its own that can be filled in per placement; symbols
	without such fields get one function text per terminal.

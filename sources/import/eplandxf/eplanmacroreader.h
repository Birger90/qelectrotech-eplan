/**
	@brief Reads the schematic of an EPLAN window macro (.ema, "EplanPxfRoot"
	XML) as manufacturers ship it inside their EDZ parts.

	Of the macro's variants the multi-line schematic (MacroFuncType 1) is
	read: lines and polylines (O34), rectangles (O89, filled when EPLAN fills
	them), connection points (O17 with a connection designation and an
	optional description such as "IN") and black-box frames (O17 with a
	frame) with their identifying letters and function text. Coordinates
	stay in EPLAN mm with y up, as EplanElementBuilder expects them.

	Pictures (manufacturer logos) and objects of other kinds are left out and
	listed in skipped().
